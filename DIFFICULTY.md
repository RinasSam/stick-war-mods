Difficulty Meter
===
You may have noticed that some mods have a difficulty rating such as "D-", "C", "X", etc. This difficulty meter is adapted from MtPain27, and is composed of the following difficulties:

```txt
E (easy) ---> D ---> C ---> B ---> A ---> X (extreme)
```

The \+ and \- signs indicate relative difficulty within the range. A "B-" difficulty corresponds to the easier "B" level mods, and "B+" would be the more difficult ones. "B" by itself is somewhere in the middle.

So a "D" difficulty is a little easier than "D+", harder than "E", but much much easier than "B".


Reference Mods

Arbitrarily assigning difficulties doesn't make sense, so we have picked reference mods to establish what each difficulty means. All the mods are ranked on "Insane" or the equivalent hardest difficulty, with no cheats or self imposed challenges.

- X: Stick War 2 Kaizo
	- X-:
	- A+:
- A: Stick War 2+ Episode 2
	- A-: Stick War 2 Hell on Earth
	- B+: The Mysterious Unknown (Unnerfed)
- B: Stick War 2 Chaos Retaliation
	- B-:
	- C+:
- C: Stick War 2 Chaos Campaign
	- C-:
	- D+: Stick War 1
- D: Stick War 2
	- D-: Stick War 3 Order Campaign
	- E+:
- E: Stick War Legacy

"E" rated mods are pretty easy.  
"D" rated mods are a challenge to the casual player, but smooth sailing to anyone versed.  
"C" mods are a fair, casual challenge.  
"B" mods are a tough challenge but still perfectly reasonable.  
"A" mods are really hard and will not be beaten in a single playsession.  
"X" mods mandate borderline perfect play.
